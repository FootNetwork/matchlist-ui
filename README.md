# Matchlist UI

This is a lightweight static prototype for testing football match listings, alternate link behavior, and simple UX layouts.

Built primarily for browser-based testing and layout experimentation â€” no actual video content is hosted or embedded.

**Note:** This repo is part of an ongoing experiment in interface behavior and link visibility. Everything here is static and non-functional by design.
